# 🚀 The Most Over-Engineered AWS CDK Project Ever!

## What is this?
This is a totally serious, production-ready AWS CDK project that definitely didn't start as "just a simple Lambda function" and somehow evolved into a distributed system worthy of a Netflix engineering blog post.

## Features
- ⏰ EventBridge rules because we're too fancy for plain old cron jobs
- 🔐 Secrets Manager integration because hardcoding credentials is so 2010
- λ Lambda functions that probably just print "Hello World" but with ENTERPRISE GRADE architecture
- 📦 Infrastructure as Code because clicking buttons in the AWS Console is for mere mortals

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account (and a healthy credit limit 💸)
- Python installed (any version that works... we're not picky)
- A sense of humor (required)
- Coffee ☕ (lots of it)
